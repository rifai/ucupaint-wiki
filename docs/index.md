![project-example](source/00.introduction/00-yang_guifei.jpg)

## What is ucupaint?

Ucupaint is addon to manage texture as layers

## Requirements

- You need at least blender 2.79 to use this addon, but more advance features only available on the modern version blender (2.80 & above).
- This addon works with both eevee and cycles.

## Installation

- Go to github.com/ucupumar/ucupaint/releases, and download according to your blender version
- Go to blender user preferences, add-ons tabs and choose install, browse your downloaded addon and click install add-on

## Limitations

- It can be really slow if you have a lot of layers with a lot of channels
- Layer group can make it even slower
- Since blender already have plan to add texture layer features built-in when I write this, when it's already available to use, you should probably use that instead, it's basically do the same thing
