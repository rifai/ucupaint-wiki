#DEFAULT CHANNELS

After the quick setup, you'll see some submenu is revealing. One of those is the "Channel" submenu. The channel list is a default channel that is set up automatically by quick setup.

Channel represents the connection between the PAINTERy node and the Principled BSDF node. PAINTERy menu is also available on the node editor context menu.

We can do some operations to the channel, add, move and remove. But for this tutorial, we will use the default channel, and let's leave it be.
