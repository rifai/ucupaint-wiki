Channel Baking the layer is important if your model will be used in other software. That's because other software can't read Blender's node shaders.
Baking channels with Ucupaint is easy, you can go to the Ucupaint special menu. It can be found on the gear icon under the Material Panel. Just click bake all channels and set the right configuration. The baking process then begins.
