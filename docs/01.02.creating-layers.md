# Creating Layers

Now we go to the "Layers" submenu. On this menu, you can add some texture layers for your object. Also, you can do some operations to the layer. Add, move, remove, and do some special operations.

There is some layer type that can help you finish your texturing process.

For now, we will try to use the "image" type. With this layer type, we can draw textures like usual. For example, let's try to create tattoos for the character's face.

The layers feature works like the layer on the regular image editor software. So, if we create another layer and draw over the new layer, it will cover the layer below.

The layer order affects the texture, so be careful when reordering the layer.
