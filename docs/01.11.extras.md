# Maximum images per Material in Blender
If you exceed the number of images, material in Blender can appear pink in the viewport. Here are some limitations found in Blender 3.6

|     GPU    | UDIM Images Limit | Standard Images Limit |
| :--------: | :---------------: | :-------------------: |
|   NVIDIA*  |        27         |          55           |
|   Radeon*  |        12         |          24           |
|   Intel    |         ?         |           ?           |
|    Mac     |         ?         |           ?           |

Since Blender 4.2, Eevee renderer has been majorly updated, and the maximum images have been reduced on Nvidia but interestingly raised in Radeon, both now have maximum of 32 image limits.

There are at least two solutions to circumvent the image limit issue: by using Vulkan or image atlas.

### Using Vulkan
For modern machines, it's recommended to use **Vulkan** on Blender 4.4 or above since it can handle more than 100 images. You can change the settings in `System` tab on Blender Preferences.

Blender 4.3 actually can also use Vulkan, but there's a bug that won't let you paint in texture paint mode.

### Converting to Image Atlas
For older Blender versions (Blender 4.3 or lesser), you can convert already used layer/mask images to image atlas.

# Tips
Here's some tips while using ucupaint
- Use less generated textures like noise or voronoi if you want the shader compilation faster
