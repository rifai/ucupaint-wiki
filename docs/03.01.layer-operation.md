We can create layer using the ![01](source/03.layers/01.png)  button with different [layer type](/03.layers/#layer_type). In this case we create new image layer.

## Move

## Advance Layer Operation

We have some advance layer operation, most of the operation is work just for image layer type. So don't be suprised if the operation might be disabled in some layer type.

Some of operation can be found in layer special menu.

### Merge Layer

Using merge layer, we can merge selected layer with the upper or lower layer. In this current version, merge layer operation have some limitation :

1. Merge layer is only work in image layer type
2. Merge layer is only support to merge one layer channel. So if you have different texture in each layer channels, only the selected layer channel will be merged.
