# Channels

## Channel in Ucupaint

A channel in Ucupaint represents a pair consisting of an input and an output within the Ucupaint node.

Each channel has at least one input and one output, but some channels, like the Normal channel, can have multiple outputs.

The base color or value of the channel is the default input of the node, as shown in the GIF below.

All inputs and outputs can be freely connected, allowing the Ucupaint node to work with your custom node setups.

In the channels list panel, you can perform basic actions such as adding, moving up/down, or removing channels.

## Creating New Channel

To create a new channel, you can use '+' button on the right of the channel list. The video below will show you how to create Emission channel.

<!-- TEMP OLD TEXT: You can create new channel by using the + button on the right of the chanels list, it will gives you channel type options, which are RGB, Value, and Normal.
For demonstration, let's try to create new channel that connect to emission socket on the principled bsdf.
Now the popup appears, if you already decided to connect it to principled bsdf, you don't have to manually name the channel, just choose emission on the dropdown, it will automatically set the name of your channel, and if you click ok, it will also connect the sockets. -->

You can see that the Ucupaint node will have new input and output sockets after you created a new channel.

## Channel Types
There are three types of channels in Ucupaint, they are RGB, Value, and Normal.

### RGB
RGB channel consists of three values of red, green, or blue. You can also enable alpha to add an alpha value, this also makes the base color transparent by default.

If alpha is activated it will automatically change your material to use alpha blend on Eevee. The default value of alpha is 0.0 so your background will be transparent.
If you create a layer with a mix blend, it will sit on top of your transparent background, which can be useful in many cases, like creating hair planes or vegetation.

### Value
Value channels consist of a single value.

### Normal
Normal channels consist of a normal vector, you can only have one normal channel per each Ucupaint node.

#### Displacement Setup
Enabling _Displacement Setup_ will do two things:

- Add subdivision surface modifiers to all objects that use the same material
- Add displacement node setup to active material

By doing this all bump maps used in layers will actually have bump geometry. Unless for layers which have 'Write Height' enabled in the layer channel settings.

## Experimental Features

#### Smoother Bump
Smooth bump can make your bump map smoother than the Blender default at the cost of precision.

#### Parallax (Experimental)
Parallax is for creating parallax effects if you're using bump map. I suggest you save your file first before activating this option since it can freeze Blender. Please note that parallax only works in perspective view. Parallax is only available if you enable experimental features in Ucupaint User Preferences.
