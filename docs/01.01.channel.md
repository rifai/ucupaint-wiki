# Channel

Channel on Ucupaint represents the input and output of Ucupaint node.

<br/>
One channel have at least one input and one output, but channel like normal can have multiple outputs at the end. The base color/value of the channel actually is the default input of the node, as demonstarated on the gif below

*If you notice that normal have default value of (999, 999, 999), just ignore that, it's basically a litlle hack to make the normal channel works properly.* 

All the inputs and outputs can be connected anywhere, so you can connect ucupaint node to your custom node setup. 
<br/>
<br/>
On channel list panel, you can do some basic operations to the channel lists, like add, move and remove.

## Creating New Channel

To create new channel, you can use '+' button on the right of the channel list. The video below will show you how to create Emission channel.

<!-- TEMP OLD TEXT: You can create new channel by using the + button on the right of the chanels list, it will gives you channel type options, which are RGB, Value, and Normal.
For demonstration, let's try to create new channel that connect to emission socket on the principled bsdf.
Now the popup appears, if you already decided to connect it to principled bsdf, you don't have to manually name the channel, just choose emission on the dropdown, it will automatically set the name of your channel, and if you click ok, it will also connect the sockets. -->

You can see Ucupaint node will have both new input and output after you created a new channel.

## Channel Types
There are three types of channel in Ucupaint, they are RGB, Value, and Normal

### RGB
RGB channel consists of three value of red, green, or blue. You can also enable alpha to add alpha value, this also make the base color transparent by default.

If alpha activated it will automatically change your material to use alpha blend on Eevee. The default value of alpha is 0.0 so your background will be transparent.
If you create a layer with mix blend, it will sit on top of your transparent background, it can be useful for many cases, like creating hair planes or vegetations

### Value
Value channel consist of single value

### Normal
Normal channel consists of normal vector, you can only have one normal channel in single Ucupaint node

#### Smooth Bump
Smooth bump can make your bump map smoother than the blender default at the cost of precision.

#### Parallax
Parallax is for create parallax effect if you're using bump map. I suggest to save your file first before activate this option since it can freeze your blender. Please note that parallax only works on perspective view.

#### Displacement
Displacement setup is only take effect when you're already baked your channels, and parallax settings will be disabled if you're using displacement.
