# Mask

Mask can be useful to hide or show certain part of the layer. It uses value 1.0 (white) as visible and 0.0 (black) as transparent.

## Setting up mask (Quick Guide)

You can access layer masks below the layer channels.

## Mask Types

Ucupaint has several mask types that can be used, which are:

### Image

Same as layer, you can also use [image](../01.02.layer/#image) as a mask.

### Vertex Color

Same as layer, you can also use [vertex color](../01.02.layer/#vertex-color) as a mask.

### Color ID

Color ID will use unique random color id that will works as mask. It uses vertex color named '__yp_color_id' to store it's color id, when the color id match then it will be valued 1.0, otherwise it will be valued 0.0. Like vertex color, Ucupaint has special editor to easily edit color id on edit mode.
