# Mask

Masks can be useful to hide or show certain part of a layer. It uses value 1.0 (white) as visible and 0.0 (black) as transparent.

## Setting up mask (Quick Guide)

You can access layer masks below the layer channels.

To add a new mask just press the '+' button and you'll be given an options menu with many mask types. More details about layer mask types can be accessed [here](#mask-types).

Choose white as the base color of the mask image, now you can paint black to mask the layer, as demonstrated below.

## Mask Types

Ucupaint has several mask types that can be used, which are:

### Image

Same as it's layer counterpart. You can also use [images](../01.02.layer/#image) as a mask.

### Vertex Color

Same as it's layer counterpart. You can also use [vertex colors](../01.02.layer/#vertex-color) as a mask.

### Color ID

Color ID will use a unique random color ID that will work as a mask. It uses vertex color named '__yp_color_id' to store its color ID, when the color IDs match, then it will be valued 1.0, otherwise it will be valued 0.0. Like vertex color, Ucupaint has special editor to easily edit color IDs in edit mode.

### Blender Generated Texture (Noise, Magic, Brick, Voronoi, etc)

Same as it's layer counterpart. You can also use [Blender generated textures](../01.02.layer/#blender-generated-textures) as masks.

### Baked Images

Same as it's layer counterpart. You can also use [baked images](../01.02.layer/#baked-images) as masks.

You can have more than one mask in a single layer.
