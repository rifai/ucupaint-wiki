## Build guide

The docs are built and deployed automatically using GitHub actions. However if you want to contribute and test changes locally, you can build the docs manually as such:

1. Get [Python](https://www.python.org/)
2. Enter the project folder
3. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run `mkdocs build` to build the docs
5. You can find the docs in a newly created folder called _"site"_
