The Ucupaint tab will appear in the N-panel when an object is selected. Before you continue, make sure to check the following: Make sure you are in Material Preview mode Make sure your object has been properly unwrapped Even though this addon supports more than just mesh objects, some features, such as baking operations, will only work with mesh objects . Creating The Ucupaint Node Ucupaint is a node group. You can create a new Ucupaint node directly in the Shader Editor. Creating new Ucupaint node in the Shader Editor In the Shader Editor, press Shift + A, go to Group, and select Ucupaint to add the node to your material. When adding a Ucupaint node in the Shader Editor, it will start with a single channel: Color. You can connect the Color output to any other node in your shader as needed. More details about channels are explained in channel page . Quick Setup You can also quickly set up the Ucupaint node in the 3D viewport by clicking the \"Quick Ucupaint Node Setup\" button. Quick setup button A pop-up menu will appear, giving you a few options for setting up the node. You can choose different shader types and add various channels. Quick setup options Here are the options available in the Quick Setup menu: Tree Name : The name of the Ucupaint node group (tree). Toggle the icon on the right to set the material name as the Ucupaint tree name. Type : The BSDF shader type that the Ucupaint node will connect to. Channels : The default set of channels included in the node (additional channels can be added later). Use Linear Color Blending : Enables linear blending between layers. This is more color-accurate but behaves differently than traditional 2D software like Photoshop. Mute Stencil mask Opacity : Disables the default texture paint overlay, allowing visibility of other layers in Material View. Switch to Material View : Automatically changes the viewport shading to Material View after setup. The OK button completes the setup process. Ucupaint is now ready to use, and the channels, along with the layer list, will be visible. Ucupaint is now ready to use! If you open the shader editor, the quick setup creates a group node connected to the default shader (Principled BSDF), based on the channels you selected earlier. Avoid editing the contents of this group node manually, as it may cause critical errors. What quick setup actually creates Linking Ucupaint Node Tree If you already have a node tree in the shader editor, the Ucupaint node will be placed between your existing nodes and the shader. It will automatically connect the existing channels through the Ucupaint node, keeping your current setup intact and working as before. See the video below for a demonstration.

In the channels list panel, you can perform basic actions such as adding, moving up/down, or removing channels. Channels list panel Note You may need to learn how to create a layer before continuing on this page. Click here to jump to the Layer page Adding a New Channel To add a new channel, use the + button next to the channel list. The video below demonstrates how to create an Emission channel in Ucupaint. Adding a new channel After creating a new channel, the Ucupaint node will display new input and output sockets corresponding to that channel. Channel Types There are three channel types in Ucupaint: RGB, Value, and Normal. RGB Channel Type An RGB channel consists of three color values: red, green, and blue. You can also enable alpha to add transparency, which makes the base color transparent by default.. RGB channel options If alpha is enabled, your material will automatically switch to Alpha Dithered method in Eevee. The default alpha value is 0.0, making the background fully transparent. If you create a layer with a mix blend, it will be placed on top of the transparent background. This can be useful for cases like creating hair planes or vegetation. Using alpha on color channel Value Channel Type Value channels consist of a single value. Value channel options Normal Channel Type Normal channels consist of a normal vector. You can have only one normal channel per Ucupaint node. Normal channel options The Height Tweak option is to multiply the value maximum displacement/bump height. It's useful for tweaking the total displacement/bump height without manually adjusting the height for each layer one by one. Displacement Setup Enabling the Displacement Setup will add extra input and output sockets to the Ucupaint node: Height , Max Height , and Vector Displacement . These outputs are connected to displacement nodes, which are automatically created when the Displacement Setup is enabled for the first time. While you can connect them to other nodes if needed, they are mainly intended to be used with the given displacement nodes. Multiple Normal Inputs and Outputs when Displacement Setup is active Enabling Displacement Setup also does the following: Adds a Subdivision Surface modifier to all objects using the same material Converts bump maps from Ucupaint layers into real displacement (unless Write Height is enabled on that layer, which disables displacement for it) The Max Polygons value controls how much the object is subdivided. It\u2019s measured in thousands; for example, a value of 1000 means up to 1 million polygons. If you enable Adaptive Subdivision (Cycles only), Ucupaint will: Enable the Experimental feature set for Cycles render Automatically configure adaptive subdivision, which adjusts detail based on the camera view Adaptive subdivision improves displacement details when you're using Cycles renderer, but may increase load time when entering render view.

Enable Experimental Features Experimental features will add more options to the Normal channel, which are Smoother Bump and Parallax . Smoother Bump (Experimental) This feature is only useful for Blender 2.7x. Smooth Bump makes your bump map appear smoother than Blender\u2019s default, but this comes at the cost of some precision and performance. Smooth Bump comparison Parallax (Experimental) The Parallax option lets you create parallax effects when using bump maps. It only works after you bake the normal channel.

UDIM There's an option to use UDIM when you create a new image layer. This option will automatically be turned on if the selected UV map has UV islands outside of the first tile. UDIM checkbox on new image layer options Image Atlas When you create a new image using Ucupaint, it will give you the option to use an image atlas. Image atlas checkbox on new image layer options If you turn on Image Atlas, the newly created layer will use a portion of a larger image. Since Blender materials have a limited number of images that can be used in a material (8-55, depending on your system, more info here ), the image atlas will use a special image that can be used as several layers or masks at the same time. This system works automatically, so you don't have to worry about it. Vertex Color Vertex color can be used as a layer. There's also a special vertex color editor in edit mode. Vertex color editor on edit mode Solid Color Solid Color layer contains only a single color, can be useful if you want to paint the mask first, then edit the solid color later. Solid color layer Background Backgound will use your base color & alpha settings as a layer, it can be useful to create holes on the surface. Fake Lighting Fake lighting will calculate fake lighting based on a given vector and matrix. If you're using camera space, it can be used for a fresnel effect.

You can also use images as a mask. Vertex Color Same as it's layer counterpart. You can also use vertex colors as a mask. Color ID Color ID will use a unique random color ID that will work as a mask. It uses vertex color named '__yp_color_id' to store its color ID, when the color IDs match, then it will be valued 1.0, otherwise it will be valued 0.0. Like vertex color, Ucupaint has special editor to easily edit color IDs in edit mode. Using Color ID mask Object Index Object Index will use pass index of an object as a mask. Using Object Index Mask Fake Lighting Same as it's layer counterpart. You can also use fake lighting as a mask. Blender Generated Texture (Noise, Magic, Brick, Voronoi, etc) Same as it's layer counterpart. You can also use Blender generated textures as masks. Baked Images Same as it's layer counterpart.

Using Rebake Menu Baked Texture Types There are several texture types that can be baked to a layer: AO AO (Ambient Occlusion) can darken the valleys or creases of your mesh. You can use options such as distance and local only. AO Pointiness Pointiness will highlight the valleys and ridges of your mesh. Since it need a lot of precision, by default, baking pointiness will use 32-bit float image as a target. Pointiness Cavity Similar to pointiness, cavity will show valleys and ridges of your meshes but with clearer distinction, it also only use a standard 8bit image by default, so it won't take a lot of space. Cavity Dust Dust is similar to the cavity map but adds additional Z top normals to the mix. Dust Paint Base Sometimes also referred to as the Blizzard or Dota diffuse map.
