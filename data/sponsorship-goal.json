  "fullDescription": "### Fellow 3D artists! \ud83d\udc4b\n\nSince 2017 I've been working on Ucupaint, a free and open source Blender addon that can help you a lot with the material creation. Until September 2025, Ucupaint has been downloaded almost 200k across the [Blender Extension Platform](https://extensions.blender.org/add-ons/ucupaint/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/ucupumar/ucupaint/releases), and the momentum is still building!\n\n### Why sponsoring me? \ud83d\ude4b\n\nSponsoring Ucupaint can help make the development sustainable. There are a lot of ideas and feature requests left to do, but the implementation takes time since I also have other responsibilities. If this funding goes well, I can put much more time into development and doing the documentation/tutorials."
